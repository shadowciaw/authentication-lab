1. the authentication schemes used by default are BasicAuthentication and SessionAuthentication. These are managed under settings.py REST_FRAMEWORKS in DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES.
2. Basic is used with -a flag
3. In session based auth, server does all the heavy lifting. The client auths with its creds and receives a session_id (can be stored as a cookie) and attaches this to every outgoing request. In token based auth, no session is kept server side and a session_id is also sent with every outgoing request, however, "a string with all the necessary information is issued (the token) which is checked after each request made by the client to the server.". token based auths are more secure than basic auth in that it generates encrypted security tokens, while basic only has username and password.
4. First the application you're logging into issues a auth request to access service resources from the user, if the user authorizes via login, the application receives an auth grant. The application requests an access token from the auth server by presenting auth of its own identity and the auth grant. if the application identity is auth'ed and the auth grant is valid, the auth server issues an access token to the app and auth is complete.
